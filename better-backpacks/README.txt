Josh Mate's Better Backpacks

Version
SPT 3.10.x

Description
Makes Backpacks bigger while still staying in line with Vanilla gameplay balance based on price / rarity / weight

Installation
Simply drop the "user" folder into your SPT folder

Modification
Change mod.ts to your liking, but be careful! Backpacks with multiple frame grids will cause visual bugs if changed! (Assuming this is a client issue?)
